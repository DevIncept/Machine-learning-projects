# Parkinson's disease Prediction Project
## Problem Statement:

<p>Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement.In this  Machine learning project, we will build a model using which we can accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in one’s body.</p>

## Approach
<p>The main goal is to detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in one’s body with the available dataset</p>
<pre> 
<li> Data Exploration     : We started exploring dataset using pandas,numpy,matplotlib and seaborn. </li>
<li> Data visualization   : Ploted graphs to get insights about dependend and independed variables. </li>
<li> Feature Engineering  :  Removed missing values and created new features as per insights.</li>
<li> Model Selection I    :  1. Tested all base models to check the base accuracy.
                             2. Also ploted residual plot to check whether a model is a good fit or not.</li>
<li> Model Selection II   :  Build a model with XGBoost classifier</li>
<li> Pickle File          :  Selected model as per best accuracy and created pickle file using joblib .</li>
<li> Webpage & deployment :  Created a webform that takes all the necessary inputs from user and shows output.
                                After that we have deployed project on heroku</li></pre>
